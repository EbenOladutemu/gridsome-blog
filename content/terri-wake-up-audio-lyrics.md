Omo shey you see  
Aah aah, uhh aah  
Omo shey you see  
Omo shey you see  
Many girls I dey see for?free  
Back then them?laugh me  
Yes I no dey?gree  
Them dey say them no dey feel my P

Everyday I wake up  
Man must to thank baba God for the favours  
Devil no fit stop us  
Manna switch location from London to Lagos  
Omo shey you see  
Omo shey you see  
Small Church don turn Ministry  
Omo shey you see

Hold side  
Hold side  
Hold side

Omo shey you see  
Omo shey you see  
Omo shey you see

Hold side  
Hold side  
Hold side

My brother, brother make you dey wake up  
My sister no dey waste time dey do make up  
If you call me for the money I go link up o  
All the hustle and the pain I dey reap off o  
Me no wan sidown dey loose guard o  
Anyhow e bi go run mo  
My brother, brother make you dey wake up

oooh, oo

Kilo wade why them want me to slogo  
Shey na me way kill e Soco  
As I dey move like this o  
Everybody dance to my disco

Kilo wade why them want me to slogo  
Shey na me way kilo Soco  
Ma lo go ma lo go, came ready ahn you know  
Kilo wade

Omo shey you see  
Omo shey you see  
Many girls I dey see for free  
Back then them laugh me  
Yes I no dey gree  
Them dey say them no dey feel my p  
Everyday I wake up  
Man must to thank baba God for the favours  
Devil no fit stop us  
Manna switch location from London to Lagos

Omo shey you see, omo shey you see  
Small church don turn ministry  
Hold side  
Hold side  
Hold side  
Omo shey you see  
Omo shey you see eee  
Omo shey you see  
Hold side  
Hold side
