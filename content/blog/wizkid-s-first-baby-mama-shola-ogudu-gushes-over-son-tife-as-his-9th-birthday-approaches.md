## **Wizkid’s first baby mama, Shola Ogudu has expressed excitement as Boluwatife’s 9th birthday approaches.**

The mother of Wizkid’s first son Boluwatife Balogun took to Twitter to share excitement for Tife’s forthcoming birthday. The beautiful fashionista added that people should start respecting her the more because it’s not an easy job raising a 9-year-old these days. Tife’s birthday is in 9 days and Shola apparently can’t keep calm.

_My Son turns 9 in 9days… Gosh! How do someone keep calm laikdeez.. Cos I can’t!!! The butterflies in my tummy are fighting to come out!!!!! Goshhh ???????? Tife is turning 9!!!! Thank you God, it’s been you ALL THE WAY!!!!!_
