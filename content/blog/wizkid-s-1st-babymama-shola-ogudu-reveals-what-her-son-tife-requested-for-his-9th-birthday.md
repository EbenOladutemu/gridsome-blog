## **Wizkid’s first son, Tife, has tendered an interesting list of the items he wants for his 9th birthday.**

Making the news earlier for gushing over her son’s 9th birthday in a few days, the fashion mogul took to her Twitter page to reveal what Tife asked for his birthday. According to her, Tife wants a ps5, Ipad, Apple laptop for his ICT class, and an iPhone. Shola added that it was at that time she knew she messed up for asking him.
