**_Lyrics:_**  
**Simi (LadiPoe)**  
I really wanna tell you how my day went  
(How my day went)  
Really want to spend the weekend  
(Babe)  
I for show you this thing I’m feeling  
(Oh yeah)  
But I don’t really know you that well

I really wanna kiss you in the face babe  
(In the face baby)  
And maybe every other place baby  
E be like say I no remember say I  
Say I no really know u that well

Aye-Aye

**Ladipoe (Simi)**  
We can go there if you  
(if I)  
Want to, but me I don’t know  
(Oh no)  
Why I think I love you  
When I don’t really know you that well  
(Know you that well)

Aye-Aye

We can go there if you  
(if I)  
Want to, but me I don’t know  
(Oh no)  
Why I think I love you  
When I don’t really know you that well

**\[Verse 1 – LadiPoe\]**  
I’m too polite to insult your intelligence why?  
Do I believe that we have met, maybe not in this life  
Time’s frozen for a second so I’m thinking tonight  
We break the ice, or better still we can set it aside  
Temporarily, my temperature is telling me that you got me so hot stop girl there is no remedy I  
But you don’t know me well enough to reply  
And I don’t really know you that well

It’s funny, you have something in your teeth, but would you try to stop me  
if I want to take it out, coz you don’t know me properly  
Girl, I think you lovely, but you turn this bad boy into a busy body

I see you’re to busy for me (yeah right)  
Or maybe I’m just busy forming (nah)  
Will you call me  
When you’re ready for me  
It’s crazy baby  
How I don’t care at all  
That I don’t really know you that well

**Simi (LadiPoe)**  
I really wanna tell you how my day went  
(How my day went)  
Really want to spend the weekend  
(Babe)  
I for show you this thing I’m feeling  
(Oh yeah)  
But I don’t really know you that well

I really wanna kiss you in the face babe  
(In the face baby)  
And maybe every other place baby  
E be like say I no remember say I  
Say I no really know u that well

Aye-Aye

**Ladipoe (Simi)**  
We can go there if you  
(if I)  
Want to, but me I don’t know  
(Oh no)  
Why I think I love you  
When I don’t really know you that well  
(Know you that well)

Aye-Aye

We can go there if you  
(if I)  
Want to, but me I don’t know  
(Oh no)  
Why I think I love you  
When I don’t really know you that well

**\[Verse 2 – Simi\]**  
So you be my controller  
See me see this paroller  
I just wanna come home to you  
Spend every night telling bad jokes to you

Be my boyfriend  
I’ll be up in my boyfriend jeans  
Have a baby with my boyfriend genes  
If you were my boyfriend I’ll be up in my boyfriend dreams  
But I don’t really know you that well

I wanna grow old with you  
Do this life with you  
Ride or die for you  
But I don’t really know you that well

**Simi (LadiPoe)**  
I really wanna tell you how my day went  
(How my day went)  
Really want to spend the weekend  
(Babe)  
I for show you this thing I’m feeling  
(Oh yeah)  
But I don’t really know you that well

E be like say I no remember say I  
Say I no really know u that well
