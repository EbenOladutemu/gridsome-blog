## Adekunle Gold dishes out a brand new record titled “Something Different”, produced by Blaise Beatz.

Golden Boy AG, **Adekunle Gold** releases another impressive song dubbed “**Something Different**“. This an Afrobeat record with the infusion of the pop sounds with strings, produced by **Blaise**. It coming after the huge success of his 2020 debut “[**Jore**](https://tooxclusive.com/adekunle-gold-jore-ft-kizz-daniel-m265/)” featuring Kizz Daniel which is still buzzing and disturbing charts.

“Something Different” has an addictive Afrobeat sound like that of Wizkid’s [Joro](https://tooxclusive.com/video-wizkid-joro/) sampled on Diamond Platnumz’s ‘[Jeje](https://tooxclusive.com/video-diamond-platnumz-jeje-prod-by-kel-p/)‘. This one is quiet different and special cuz of the additional Trumpets and Saxophones.

Listen to AG Baby’s melodious sound
