## **Nigerian producer, DJ Cuppy has surprised the little South African girl she promised to sponsor with a huge gift.**

You would recall that a little South African girl caught the attention of the “**Gelato**” singer on social media after her mom posted a video of her rocking a hairstyle similar to that of Cuppy. **Cuppy** reacted to the tweet calling her the next generation cuppy and promised to support her education.

_“I think we found the next generation Cuppy! ? Tell her parents to get in touch with info@cuppyfoundation.org ?? Would LOVE to support her education”_
