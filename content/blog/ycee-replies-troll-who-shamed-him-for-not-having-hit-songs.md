## **Nigerian rapper, Ycee seemed to have the perfect answer for a Twitter user who trolled him for not having hit songs.**

The conversation started when a Twitter user identified as Charles took to the social media platform to state that if an armed robber put a gun to head and told him to mention two of the rapper’s hit songs, he would be dead immediately. _“If an armed robber put a gun on my head and asked me to mention 2 of Ycee’s hit songs, I’d be dead!”_ **Ycee** savagely responded that his death would be as a result of his own ignorance. He wrote: _“and it would be your ignorance that killed you”_
