## WurlD shows no sign of relenting as he dishes out a brand new song dubbed [“Wayo” (Kpe Le Wu)](https://platoon.lnk.to/WayoKpeLeWu).

Talented Soul/Afrobeat singer **WurlD** releases a new impressive single titled “**Wayo**“. This another track off the forthcoming ‘AfroSoul’ EP. The new AfroSoul, AfroPop, Afrobeat record produced by **Kel P**, **Teflon Zinc Fence** is a follow up to his previous; ‘[Ghost Town](https://tooxclusive.com/wurld-ghost-town-prod-by-spax/)‘, ‘[Love Nobody](https://tooxclusive.com/wurld-love-nobody-prod-by-tmxo/)‘.

“**Wayo**” is the Nigerian slang for “Mind Games”. WurlD’s singular request of his lover is to not play games with his heart as his feelings grow increasingly inundating. On this new release WurlD is crazy in love illustrated in the lyrics “_..and I’ll do anything for you. go to war, rob a bank for you..they say I don day craze. too late to turn away._”
