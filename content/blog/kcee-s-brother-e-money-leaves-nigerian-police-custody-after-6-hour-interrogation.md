## **Nigerian billionaire businessman and Kcee’s brother, E-Money has left police custody after a 6 hour investigation.**

**E-Money** who is the chairman of Five Star music group had 6 of his police escorts withdrawn after it was reported that he allegedly treated the policemen like domestic servants.
