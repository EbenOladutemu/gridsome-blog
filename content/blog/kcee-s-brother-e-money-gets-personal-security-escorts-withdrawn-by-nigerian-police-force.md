## **The Lagos State Police Command has withdrawn policemen attached to the Chairman, Five Star Group, Emeka Okonkwo popularly known as E-Money.**

According to Punch, an interview with the Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana confirmed that 6 policemen attached to the music boss have been withdrawn. It was reported that **E-Money** had become the subject of a police investigation due to his flamboyant lifestyle and alleged misuse of orderlies.

**E-Money** angered the police when it was revealed that police en attached to him were used as domestic servants carrying umbrellas, opening doors, and doing menial jobs for him. E-money was found to be using high ranked officers instead of the regular MOPOLS. It was also stated that he would be invited for questioning and the policemen would be interrogated.

_“I can confirm that E-Money’s policemen have been withdrawn. We were ordered to do so and the directive has been complied with. I do not know the reason for the order at this time. We received a signal from the Force headquarters on Monday that the police detail of music executive, E-Money, be immediately withdrawn and an investigation into the man be launched._

_The IG was surprised that policemen were attached to him in the first place and were being used as domestic servants, carrying umbrellas, opening doors and doing menial jobs for him. The policemen were discovered to be attached to B Operations at the command headquarters and not MOPOL which is the usual practice. So, we have withdrawn his policemen and we are inviting him for questioning. The policemen will also be interrogated._
