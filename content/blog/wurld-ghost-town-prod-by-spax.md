## With his latest hit “[Love Nobody](https://tooxclusive.com/wurld-love-nobody-prod-by-tmxo/)” still buzzing, WurlD releases a new AfroSoul single titled “Ghost Town”, produced by [Spax](https://www.instagram.com/spaxclassic/).

**WurlD**’s stellar penmanship is further displayed in “**Ghost Town**“, as its lyrics open up discussions around the feelings of loneliness that often come with chasing a dream. Haters disguised as friends, Idols become rivals, the burnout one feels when the journey seems prolonged, and the fear of losing it all when you get to the top.

’_When chasing a dream, the path is long and may get lonely, but be careful not to lose your soul_’ is the underlying message in the Ghost Town record, and WurlD uses phrases like “_Pray I make it home alive.._” to emphasize that. The added emphasis on ‘_Hitting the bullseye_’ is the desperate need to get it right every time. Everybody loves you then, but one miss, could bring you down, and you may end up in a ghost town- back where you started.

Listen to the Afrosoul record below and Enjoy! pure vibes
